You are totally free to invest that time doing other essential things when you employ a pest control company. In the last couple of years, pest control has ended up being more technically involved, with licencing and limitations on chemicals," Dr. Siddiqi states.</p>

<p>In Asia, various phases of IPM have actually been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997). </p>
