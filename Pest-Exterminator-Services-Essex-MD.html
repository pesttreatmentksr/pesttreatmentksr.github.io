Pest exclusion with netting or row covers, vacuuming or handpicking to eliminate pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, customizing ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sterilization or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>

Trap crops are planted to hold and attract pest insects where they can be handled more effectively and avoid or decrease their movement onto valuable crops. Schedules are used to categorize pesticides and to control the accessibility of an item to the public. Termites need moisture for their survival, thus damp walls, leakage and water seepage resemble open invites for them.</p>
<p>So, pest control need to be performed at the time you have even observed the indication of pest infestation at your facility. Do safely and properly utilize pesticides.
