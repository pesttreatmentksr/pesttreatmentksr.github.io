Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is commonly known, is a system of managing pests which is designed to be sustainable.</p>

However the exterminators not just assist you in getting rid of the pests from your home, but they make sure the pests will not return. IPM worries making use of non-chemical control methods, such as exemption or trapping, before chemical options.</p>

Natural or non-synthetic pesticides: Botanical-based pesticides fall into this IPM group. Threat for animals - pesticides eliminate non-target (safe or useful) types that habituate in the orchards or fields.
