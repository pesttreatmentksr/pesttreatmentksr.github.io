<p>Termites are such harmful pests that you want your termite treatment to lead to termite extermination. As soon as identification, action, and monitoring thresholds suggest that pest control is needed, and preventive approaches are no longer effective or available, IPM programs then evaluate the appropriate control approach both for effectiveness and threat. The letter of invite for this plenary address suggested for its title the central theme of the entire Congress, i.e., the affirmative sentence: "Integrated Pest Management: A Global Truth".</p>
<p>There are more than 40,000 companies dealing with these services and products worldwide, thus leading to an extremely fragmented competitive landscape.
